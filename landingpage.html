Here's the modified code:To get the footer to be at the bottom of the webpage, you need to modify the HTML and CSS code. Here's one way to achieve this:
Wrap all the content inside the body tag with a div tag with a class of "content". This div will act as a container for all the content in the body.
Set the min-height property of the "content" div to 100vh in CSS. This will make the div at least as tall as the viewport.
Set the box-sizing property of the "content" div to border-box to make sure that any padding or borders included in the height of the element.
Set the padding-bottom property of the "content" div to the height of the footer.
Add a footer element after the "content" div.Here's the modified code:To get the footer to be at the bottom of the webpage, you need to modify the HTML and CSS code. Here's one way to achieve this:
